## User stories

(US-001) As a new developer; I need to set up a wallet and fund it with Testnet INJ; so that I can developer and deploy smart contracts on Injective Testnet.


(US-002) As a developer with an existing application that works on another EVM blockchain; I would like to port that application to work on Injective EVM; so that my application can be cross-chain.


(US-003) As a new developer; I would like to write a smart contract in Solidity, then compile, deploy it on Injective Testnet, plus verify it on Blockscout; so that I can then create a dApp that interacts with that smart contract.


(US-004) As a new developer that has just deployed smart contract on Injective Testnet; I would like to create a dApp that interacts with my smart contract that works with EVM browser wallets; so that users of my application can actually use my application.


(US-005) As an experienced developer who has already deployed, tested, and audited my application on Injective Testnet; I would like to redeploy that same application on Injective Mainnet; so that users of my application can use it in production with real INJ and other on-chain assets.
